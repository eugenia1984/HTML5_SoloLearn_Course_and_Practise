        <!-- THE NAV ELEMENT:
        This tag represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to certain sections within the page. 
        This would be a section with navigation links.
        Not all of the links in a document should be inside a <nav> element. 
        The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. 
        Typically, the <footer> element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element.-->
      </header>

        <!-- THE ARTICLE ELEMENT 
        Articleis a self-contained, independent piece of content that can be used and distributed separately 
        from the rest of the page or site. 
        This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content.
        The <article> element replaces the <div> element that was widely used in HTML4, along with an id or class. 
        When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. 
        For example, blog post comments can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.-->

        <!-- THE SECTION ELEMENT: 
        <section> is a logical container of the page or article.
        Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
        For example, a homepage could have a section for introducing the company, another for news items, and still another for contact information.
        Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element. 
        If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a <section> element, use an <article> element instead-->
        
        <!-- THE ASIDE ELEMENT:
        <aside> is secondary or tangential content which could be considered separate from but indirectly related to the main content.
        This type of content is often represented in sidebars.
        When an <aside> tag is used within an <article> tag, the content of the <aside> should be specifically related to that article. 
        When an <aside> tag is used outside of an <article> tag, its content should be related to the surrounding content.-->

        <article> 
            <h1> The article title </h1> 
            <P> Web page main content </P>

        <!--AUDIO:
        There are two different ways to specify the audio source file's URL. 
        - The first uses the source attribute:
        <audio src="audio.mp3" controls>    Audio element not supported by your browser </audio> 

        - The second way uses the <source> element inside the <audio> element:
        <audio controls>    
            <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
            Audio element not supported by your browser. 
        </audio> 

        ***The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will display in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
        - Multiple <source> elements can be linked to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format.
        - Currently, there are three supported file formats for the <audio> element: MP3, WAV, and OGG.

        AUDIO ATTRIBUTES:
        - controls: Specifies that audio controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button, etc.)
        - autoplay: When this attribute is defined, audio starts playing as soon as it is ready, without asking for the visitor's permission.
        <audio controls autoplay>
        - loop: This attribute is used to have the audio replay every time it is finished.
        <audio controls autoplay loop> -->

        <!-- VIDEO:
        You can specify the video source URL using an attribute in a video element, or using source elements inside the video element:
        <video controls autoplay loops>               (autoplay loops:the video will replay after it finishes playing)
         <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
         <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
          Video is not supported by your browser
        </video>
    
        -Attributes: one  aspect shared by both the audio and the video elements is that each has controls, autoplay and loop attributes.-->

        <!--PROGRESS BAR:
        Provides the ability to create progress bars on the web.
        It can be used within headings, paragraphs, or anywhere else in the body.

        - Progress Element Attributes
        Value: Specifies how much of the task has been completed.
        Max: Specifies how much work the task requires in total.
    
        Example of a progress bar that shows 35 percent of progress:
        Status: <progress min="0" max="100" value="35">
        </progress>
    
        Use the <progress> tag in conjunction with JavaScript to dynamically display a task's progress.-->

        <!--WEB STORAGE:
        With HTML5 web storage, websites can store data on a user's local computer.
        Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript cookies to achieve this functionality.

        The Advantages of Web Storage: More secure, Faster, Stores a larger amount of data, 
        Stored data is not sent with every server request.
        Local storage is per domain. All pages from one domain can store and access the same data.
    
        There are two types of web storage objects:
        - sessionStorage() : is destroyed once the user closes the browser
        - localStorage() : data with no expiration date.
        **You need to be familiar with basic JavaScript in order to understand and use the API.
    
        Working with Values:

        The syntax for web storage for both local and session storage is very simple and similar.
        The data is stored as key/value pairs.

        Storing a Value:
        localStorage.setItem("key1", "value1");

        Getting a Value:
        //this will print the value
        alert(localStorage.getItem("key1")); 

        Removing a Value:
        localStorage.removeItem("key1");

        Removing All Values:
        localStorage.clear();

        **The same syntax applies to the session storage, with one difference: Instead of localStorage, sessionStorage is used.-->

        <!-- GEOLOCATION API:
        In HTML5, the Geolocation API is used to obtain the user's geographical location.
        Since this can compromise user privacy, the option is not available unless the user approves it.
        Geolocation is much more accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones and the like.
    
        The Geolocation API’s main method is getCurrentPosition, which retrieves the current geographic location of the user's device.
        Example:  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition();
    
        Parameters:
        - showLocation (mandatory): Defines the callback method that retrieves location information.
        - ErrorHandler(optional): Defines the callback method that is invoked when an error occurs in processing the asynchronous call.
        - Options (optional): Defines a set of options for retrieving the location information.
        *** You need to be familiar with basic JavaScript in order to understand and use the API.
    
        Presenting Data:
        User location can be presented in two ways: Geodetic and Civic.

        1. The geodetic way to describe position refers directly to latitude and longitude.
        2. The civic representation of location data is presented in a format that is more easily read and understood by the average person.
    
        Each parameter has both a geodetic and a civic representation, example:
        ATTRIBUTE      GEODETIC      CIVIC
        Position      59.3,18.6     Stockholm
        Elevation     10meters      4th floor
        Heading       5km/h         walking
        Orientation   45degrees     north-east-->

        <!--MAKING ELEMENTS GRASSABLE:
        
        The drag and drop feature lets you "grab" an object and drag it to a different location.
        To make an element draggable, just set the draggable attribute to true:
        <img draggable="true" />
        Any HTML element can be draggable.

        The API for HTML5 drag and drop is event-based. Example:
        <!DOCTYPE HTML>
        <html>
            <head>
                <script>
                function allowDrop(ev) {
                ev.preventDefault();
                }

                function drag(ev) {
                ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
                }

                function drop(ev) {
                ev.preventDefault();
                var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("text");
                ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
                }
                </script>
            </head>
            <body>

                <div id="box" ondrop="drop(event)" ondragover="allowDrop(event)" style="border:1px solid black; width:200px; height:200px"></div>

                <img id="image" src="sample.jpg" draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)" width="150" height="50" alt="" />

            </body>
        </html>

    **What to Drag?
    When the element is dragged, the ondragstart attribute calls a function, drag(event), which specifies what data is to be dragged.
    The dataTransfer.setData() method sets the data type and the value of the dragged data:

        function drag(ev) {
        ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
        }

    In our example, the data type is "text" and the value is the ID of the draggable element ("image").

    **Where to Drop?
    The ondragover event specifies where the dragged data can be dropped. By default, data and elements cannot be dropped in other elements. To allow a drop, we must prevent the default handling of the element.
    This is done by calling the event.preventDefault() method for the ondragover event.

    *** Do the Drop
    When the dragged data is dropped, a drop event occurs.
    In the example above, the ondrop attribute calls a function, drop(event):
        function drop(ev) {
        ev.preventDefault();
        var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("text");
        ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
        }

    The preventDefault() method prevents the browser's default handling of the data (default is open as link on drop).
    The dragged data can be accessed with the dataTransfer.getData() method. This method will return any data that was set to the same type in the setData() method.
    The dragged data is the ID of the dragged element ("image").

    At the end, the dragged element is appended into the drop element, using the appendChild() function.
    Basic knowledge of JavaScript is required to understand and use the API. -->

    <!-- Drawing shapes:
    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and is used to draw shapes with HTML-style markup.
    It offers several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
    SVG is not pixel-based, so it can be magnified infinitely with no loss of quality.

    **Inserting SVG Images:
    An SVG image can be added to HTML code with just a basic image tag that includes a source attribute pointing to the image:
        <img src="image.svg" alt="" height="300" width="300px"/>
    SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format
    
    **DRAWING A CIRCLE:
    To draw shapes with SVG, you first need to create an SVG element tag with two attributes: width and height.
    To create a circle, add a <circle> tag.
    - cx pushes the center of the circle further to the right of the screen
    - cy pushes the center of the circle further down from the top of the screen
    - r defines the radius
    - fill determines the color of our circle
    - stroke adds an outline to the circle
    ****Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated-->


<p> Drawing ONE circle with a SVF tag:</p>

<svg width="2000" height="200">
<circle cx="80" cy="80" r="50" fill="green" />
</svg>
<P> Drawing another circle with a SVF tag</P>
<svg width="800" height="300">
<circle cx="50" cy="240" r="10" fill="red" />
</svg>

<!-- Other Shape Elements: <rect> defines a rectangle.
The width and height attributes of the <rect> element define the height and the width of the rectangle.-->

<p> Drawing a rectangle with a RECT tag: </p>

   <rect width="300" height="100" x="20" y="20" fill="blue" />
</svg>

<!--LINE SEGMENT: (x1, y1) define the start coordinates(x2, y2) define the end coordinates. -->

<!-- <polyline> defines shapes built from multiple line definitions.
Points are the polyline's coordinates.  -->

<p> A shape built from multiple line definitions</p>
<svg width="2000" height="400">

</svg>

<!--ELIPSE: is similar to the <circle>, with one exception:
You can independently change the horizontal and vertical axes of its radius, using the rx and ry attributes. -->

<P> Elipse </P>
<svg height="400" width="1000">
    <ellipse cx="200" cy="100" rx="150" ry="70" style="fill:rgb(0, 87, 128)" />
 </svg>

<!--POLYGON:
The <polygon> element is used to create a graphic with at least three sides. 
The polygon element is unique because it automatically closes off the shape for you.
Polygon comes from Greek. "Poly" means "many" and "gon" means "angle."-->

<P> Polygon </P>
<svg width="2000" height="400">
    <polygon points="100 100, 200 200, 300 0" style="fill: rgb(128, 0, 92); stroke:black;" />
    </svg>

<!-- SHAPE ANIMATION: 
SVG animations can be created using the <animate> element. 
attributeName: Specifies which attribute will be affected by the animation
from: Specifies the starting value of the attribute
to: Specifies the ending value of the attribute
dur: Specifies how long the animation runs (duration)
fill: Specifies whether or not the attribute's value should return to its initial value when the animation is finished (Values: "remove" resets the value; "freeze" keeps the “to value”)
repeatCount: Specifies the repeat count of the animation

To repeat the animation indefinitely, use the value "indefinite" for the repeatCount attribute.-->

<p> Creates a rectangle that will change its position in 3 seconds and will then repeat the animation twice: </p>
    <svg width="1000" height="250">
      <rect width="150" height="150" fill="orange">
       <animate attributeName="x" from="0" to="300" dur="3s" fill="freeze" repeatCount="2"/> 
      </rect>
    </svg>


<!-- PATHS: The <path> element is used to define a path.
The following commands are available for path data:
M: moveto
L: lineto
H: horizontal lineto
V: vertical lineto
C: curveto
S: smooth curveto
Q: quadratic Bézier curve
T: smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
A: elliptical Arc
Z: closepath 
***All of the above commands can also be expressed with lower case letters. 
When capital letters are used, it indicates absolute position; lower case indicates relative position.-->

<p> M places our "virtual pen" down at the position 0, 0. It then moves 200px down and to the right, 
    then moves up to the position 200, 0. 
    The Z command closes the shape, which results in a hypotenuse: </p>
<svg width="500" height="450">
    <path d="M 0 0 L200 200 L200 0 Z" style="stroke:rgb(148, 224, 26);  fill:none;" />
</svg>

<p> M places our "virtual pen" down at the position 0, 0. It then moves 100px down and to the right, 
        then moves up to the position 100, 0. 
        The Z command closes the shape, which results in a square: </p>
<svg width="500" height="450">
    <path d="M0 0  L0 100 L100 100  L100 0  Z"  style="stroke:rgb(224, 194, 26);  fill:none;" />
</svg>

<!-- THE CANVAS ELEMENT:
The HTML canvas is used to draw graphics that include everything from simple lines to complex graphic objects.
The <canvas> element is defined by:
    <canvas id="canvas1" width="200" height="100">  </canvas>
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. 
You must use a script to actually draw the graphics (usually JavaScript).
The <canvas> element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript.
    getContext() returns a drawing context on the canvas 

Example:

<canvas id="canvas1" width="400" height="300">  </canvas> 
    <script>
       var can = document.getElementById("canvas1"); 
       var ctx = can.getContext("2d");
    </script> 

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics.
 Canvas Coordinates

The HTML canvas is a two-dimensional grid.
The upper-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0,0).
X coordinate increases to the right.
Y coordinate increases toward the bottom of the canvas. -->

<!-- DRAWING SHAPES:
The fillRect(x, y, w, h) method draws a "filled" rectangle, in which w indicates width and h indicates height. 
The default fill color is black.

A black 100*100 pixel rectangle is drawn on the canvas at the position (20, 20):
    var c=document.getElementById("canvas1");
    var ctx=c.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillRect(20,20,100,100);

    Drawing Shapes

The fillRect(x, y, w, h) method draws a "filled" rectangle, in which w indicates width and h indicates height. The default fill color is black.

A black 100*100 pixel rectangle is drawn on the canvas at the position (20, 20):
    var c=document.getElementById("canvas1");
    var ctx=c.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillRect(20,20,100,100);

The canvas supports various other methods for drawing:

DRA A LINE:
moveTo(x,y): Defines the starting point of the line.
lineTo(x,y): Defines the ending point of the line.

DRAW A CIRCLE:
beginPath(): Starts the drawing.
arc(x,y,r,start,stop): Sets the parameters of the circle.
stroke(): Ends the drawing.

GRADIENTS:
createLinearGradient(x,y,x1,y1): Creates a linear gradient.
createRadialGradient(x,y,r,x1,y1,r1): Creates a radial/circular gradient.

DRAWING TEXT ON TE CANCAS:
Font: Defines the font properties for the text.
fillText(text,x,y): Draws "filled" text on the canvas.
strokeText(text,x,y): Draws text on the canvas (no fill).
-->

<!--CANVA VS SVG:

Canvas
- Elements are drawn programmatically
- Drawing is done with pixels
- Animations are not built in
- High performance for pixels-based drawing operations
- Resolution dependent
- No support for event handlers
- You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
- Well suited for graphic-intensive games

SVG
- Elements are part of the page's DOM (Document object model)
- Drawing is done with vectors
- Effects, such as animations are built in
- Based on standard XML syntax, which provides better accessibility
- Resolution independent
- Support for event handlers
- Not suited for game applications
- Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (for example, Google Maps)

You can actually use both SVG and canvas on the same page, if needed.
However, you cannot just draw SVG onto a canvas, or vice-versa. -->

<!--WORKING WITH CANVAS:

The Canvas element can be transformed. As an example, a text is written on the canvas at the coordinates (10, 30). 
    ctx.font="bold 22px Tahoma";
    ctx.textAlign="start";
    ctx.fillText("start", 10, 30);

The translate(x,y) method is used to move the Canvas.
x indicates how far to move the grid horizontally, and y indicates how far to move the grid vertically.
    ctx.translate(100, 150);
    ctx.fillText("after translate", 10, 30);

The rotate() method is used to rotate the HTML5 Canvas. 
The value must be in radians, not degrees.
Here is an example that draws the same rectangle before and after rotation is set:
    ctx.fillStyle = "#FF0000";
    ctx.fillRect(10,10, 100, 100);

    ctx.rotate( (Math.PI / 180) * 25);  //rotate 25 degrees.

    ctx.fillStyle = "#0000FF";
    ctx.fillRect(10,10, 100, 100);

The scale() Method:
The scale() method scales the current drawing. It takes two parameters:
- The number of times by which the image should be scaled in the X-direction.
- The number of times by which the image should be scaled in the Y-direction.
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    ctx =canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.font="bold 22px Tahoma";
    ctx.textAlign="start";
    ctx.fillText("start", 10, 30);
    ctx.translate(100, 150);
    ctx.fillText("after translate", 0, 0);
    ctx.rotate(1);
    ctx.fillText("after rotate", 0, 0);
    ctx.scale(1.5, 4);
    ctx.fillText("after scale", 0,20);-->

    <!-- HTML5 FORMS:
    HTML5 brings many features and improvements to web form creation. 
    There are new attributes and input types that were introduced to help create better experiences for web users.
    Use the novalidate attribute to avoid form validation on submissions.
    HTML5 has introduced a new attribute called placeholder. 
    On <input> and <textarea> elements, this attribute provides a hint to the user of what information can be entered into the field.
        <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="email@example.com" />
    The autofocus attribute makes the desired input focus when the form loads:
        <form>
            <label for="email">Your e-mail address: </label> 
            <input type="text" name="email" autofocus/>
        </form>
    
    Forms with Required Fields

    The "required" attribute is used to make the input elements required.
        <form autocomplete="off">
            <label for="e-mail">Your e-mail address: </label>
                <input name="Email" type="text" required />

<!-- CREATING A SEARCH BOX: 
The new search input type can be used to create a search box:
    <input id="mysearch" name="searchitem" type="search" /> 
You must remember to set a name for your input; otherwise, nothing will be submitted.

Search Options:
The <datalist> tag can be used to define a list of pre-defined options for the search field:
<option> defines the options in a drop-down list for the user to select.
The ID of the datalist element must match with the list attribute of the input box.-->

<p> Example of a search option form: </p>
<form>
    <input type="text" name="color" list="colors" />
    <datalist id="colors">
    <option value="Red">
    <option value="Green">
    <option value="Yellow">
</datalist>
